# Algorithms-ObjC

This is a repository with various algorithms written in Objective-C as a desktop OSX application.  The reason for a desktop OSX app is due to the fact that Xcode automatically does not add the Testing frameworks to command line apps.  This is makes it for a quick start up.

The basic format is
1) Class that performs the algorithm.
2) Associated tests that verify the algorithm.

Currently, performance is not measured, but will be added in the future.
